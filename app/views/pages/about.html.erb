        <p>  I was born and raised in Arizona.  I've been a web developer for about 4 years now if ya scrunch it all together; I knew I loved code the moment I laid eyes on it. With the rest of my time I'm an avid motorcycle rider, musician (singer), and old fashioned family man that values quality time and a little adventure.</p>
